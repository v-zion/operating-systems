Lab 10. CS333. Autumn 2018
--------------------------

1. lab10.pdf describes the lab statement.

2. The directory 'test-programs' contains a sample test
   program to verify correctness of part 1 and part 2

3. The default signal handler prints the following message.
   Default handler: PID: <pid>. Signal type: <signal type> 

4. To verify part 2 implementation, run different test case
   using the given test program 'priority.c' by changing the 
   priority of child processes like,

   1. Child i has priority (i+1);
   	i.e., priority of children 0 to n-1 varies from 1 to n

   2. Child i has priority N-i (where N is number of children)
      i.e.,. priority of children 0 to N-1 varies from N to 1

   3. All children have same priority, set to 5.


   Run this test program as 
   ./priority <number-of-children>
   Eg. : $./priority 10

5. The directory 'sample-outputs' contains sample outputs for
   both part1 and part2.
