--------------------------

1. lab11.pdf describes the lab statement.

2. Compile and executes the programs using the following commands:
   $ gcc emufs.c disk.c testcase-common.c testcaseY.c -o testcaseY
   $ ./testcaseY

3. Delete the disk images created by a testcase before executing the
   same testcase again.
  
4. The directory 'test-cases' contains test cases to the correctness
   of your implementation.
   
5. The directory 'sample-output' contains the sample outputs.

6. For testcase0, an image file, testcase0.img, is given and can be
   used to test implementation of the file system API.

7. Use the 'less' command to check contents of the emulated disk
   $ less ./testcase0.img 

8. Try replacing with any other existing file to emulate the disk.
   Reason about the output.

9. Rerun the testcase 1 to 5 by setting the 'TEST_FS_NUMBER' to 'EMUFS_ENCRYPTED'
