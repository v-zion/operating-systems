1. lab9.pdf describes the lab statement.

2. The directory 'test-programs' contains sample programs for
   exercise 1 and 3.

3. The directory 'sample-outputs' contains the samples 
   outputs for all exercises

4. Input format for reader-writer program,
   ./reader-writer <r/w> <no-of-threads> <thread-arrival-delay in ms> ...
   Any number of readers/writers can be added with repetitions 
   of above mentioned 3 tuple.

   Each thread has to wait for 'thread-arrival-delay' ms before it
   starts reading or writing. The delay should be inside the thread
   start function and one of the first activity. Use the given function 
   'delay' for inducing the delay. 
   After the delay, the reader threads acquire the reader-writer lock, 
   print the value of shared data variable, and release the lock.
   Similarly, the writers acquire the reader-writer lock, increment
   the shared data variable, display its value, and release the lock.

   Refer the sample outputs for display formats.
